      Our enemies are many —<br>
      Our passes are more.<br>
      They came with fire —<br>
      We danced on their ashes!<br>
      England roared —<br>
      We silenced the crown!<br>
      Germany charged —<br>
      We passed them to death!<br>
      Italy prayed —<br>
      We broke their defense!<br>
      France dreamed —<br>
      We shattered their sleep!<br>
      We did not run —<br>
      We did not hide —<br>
      We pressed, we passed, we scored!<br><br>
      The fire of <strong>Messi</strong>!<br>
      The rage of <strong>Suárez</strong>!<br>
      The rhythm of <strong>Neymar</strong>!<br>
      The vision of <strong>Iniesta</strong>!<br>
      The mind of <strong>Xavi</strong>!<br>
      The flame of <strong>Dani Alves</strong>!<br><br>
      Say it! Say it!<br>
      We are Barça!<br>
      We are more than a club!<br>
      We are the storm you fear at night!<br>
      We are the pass before the goal!
